              Book Recommendations From Elon Musk That Will Advance Your

              Elon Musk, the mastermind behind SpaceX, Tesla, and Paypal is also
              passionate about reading. He credits most of his success to the
              books he read as both a child and as an adult. His family says
              that as a kid, he always had a book with him where ever he went.
              His mother told Tad Friend of The New Yorker, “Elon would
              accompany me to dinner parties if I didn’t have a date. I’d bring
              him to meet some interesting adults, and he’d hide a book under
              the table to read if they weren’t interesting enough.” His brother
              had a similar anecdote recalling that Musk would read up to two
              books in a day. Take it from one of the most successful people in
              tech and add these books Musk’s recommends to your Goodreads’
              list.
