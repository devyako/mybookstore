              Bill Gates: Read These 5 Books to Get 2020 Off to a Good Start
            </a>
            <a style={{ fontSize: "17px" }}>
              For a healthier, smarter, and richer 2020, Bill Gates is
              recommending five books on topics including history, education,
              and personal health. The 64-year-old billionaire philanthropist
              posted his year-end book list on his blog, GatesNotes, earlier
              this month. In recommending Matthew Walker’s book, Why We Sleep,
              Gates says: “Walker has persuaded me to change my bedtime habits
              to up my chances. If your New Year’s resolution is to be healthier
              in 2020, his advice is a good place to start.” Gates, who has a
              net worth of $108.3 billion by Forbes’ real-time estimates, has
              been a voracious reader from a young age. He reads about 50 books
              a year and frequently updates his book reviews on his blog.
